# Credit Card Approval Prediction

## Overview
Credit card approval prediction is a machine learning project that automates the process of determining whether a credit card application should be approved or rejected. By analyzing applicant data, such as income, employment status, and credit history, the model provides insights into key factors influencing approval decisions. This project aims to improve decision-making efficiency for financial institutions while ensuring fairness in predictions.

## Technologies Used
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Libraries & Frameworks**: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn
- **Machine Learning Models**: Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost
- **Tools**: Jupyter Notebook, Google Colab, VS Code

## Dataset
- The dataset contains applicant details such as age, income, credit score, and employment type.
- Available on platforms like Kaggle or UCI Machine Learning Repository.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection**: Gather historical credit card application data.
2. **Data Preprocessing**: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and scale numerical data.
3. **Feature Engineering**: Identify key factors influencing credit card approval.
4. **Model Training & Evaluation**:
   - Train various machine learning models.
   - Evaluate models using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
5. **Visualization**:
   - Heatmaps, correlation matrices, and feature importance graphs.
6. **Deployment**: Deploy model using Flask, Streamlit, or FastAPI for real-time predictions.

## Project Outcomes
- Achieved over 90% accuracy using Random Forest and Gradient Boosting models.
- Identified income, credit history, and employment type as critical factors.
- Built a fair and unbiased model for assessing creditworthiness.
- Provided financial institutions with a data-driven approach to approval processes.
